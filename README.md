Heavily inspired (as in: a lot of data copied from) by [Faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js/)

```swift

var fakeGuy = Faker()

print(fakeGuy.firstName)
print(fakeGuy.lastName)
print(fakeGuy.title)
print(fakeGuy.nameSuffix)
print(fakeGuy.fullName)

print(fakeGuy.streetName)
print(fakeGuy.streetNo)
print(fakeGuy.city)
print(fakeGuy.state)
print(fakeGuy.zip)

print(fakeGuy.address1)
print(fakeGuy.address2)
print(fakeGuy.fullAddress)

print(fakeGuy.bornYear)
print(fakeGuy.bornMonth)
print(fakeGuy.bornDay)
print(fakeGuy.fullDate)

print(fakeGuy.phone)
print(fakeGuy.email)
